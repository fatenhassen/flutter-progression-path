# profile_card_app

a responsive profile card screen with dark/light mode.

This marks the beginning of my Flutter development journey — starting with the essentials.

This wasn’t about building a full app, but mastering the foundations of UI composition:

Crafting a clean one-screen layout using Column, Row, Card, and spacing widgets

Integrating custom fonts and local assets

Implementing dark/light mode switching using ThemeData

Structuring a responsive layout with minimalist design principles


💡 Why this task matters:
Even the simplest screens reveal a lot about your grasp of layout, theming, and user-centric design. I wanted to make sure I understand the core of Flutter's widget system before moving on to dynamic logic and navigation.

🛠️ Tools & Concepts Used:

Flutter (Dart)

Stateless and Stateful widgets

Theme switching

Custom styling and asset management
