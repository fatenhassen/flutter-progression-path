# 🛠️ Flutter_Progression_Tasks Repo

A growing collection of Flutter tasks and small projects that I’ve built as part of my continuous learning and professional development in mobile development.

Each folder in this repository represents a self-contained task or mini-project — developed, completed, and committed clean, working code tied to real practice and understanding.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

This is not a portfolio of polished apps.  
It’s a code log — a real, working journal of the tasks and projects I’ve completed with Flutter.

Each task is:
- ✅ Self-contained and runnable
- 🧠 Focused on learning a specific concept or skill
- 🧼 Written with clean code and meaningful structure

This repo reflects how I actually learn — by building.

## 🚀 How to Run

Each folder is its own Flutter app.  
To run any of them:

`bash
cd FolderName
flutter pub get
flutter run
